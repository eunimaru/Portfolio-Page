    <h2><strong>During my last 4 weeks in Epicodus I have created the following projects</strong></h2>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/eunimaru/hello-world/blob/master/hello-world.html">Hello World</a></li>
      <p>This was an html project about writing the word "hello" in different languages.</p>
      <li><a href= "https://github.com/eunimaru/my-first-webpage/blob/master/my-first-webpage.html">My First Webpage</a></li>
      <p>This was my first webpage assignment where I used strong tags and inserted my first url link. This was created just with HTML</p>
      <li><a href= "https://github.com/eunimaru/cookie-recipe/blob/master/cookie-recipe.html">Cookie Recipe</a></li>
      <p>This was an HTML assignmet where I fixed spacing and indentation.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/eunimaru/ID">ID</a></li>
      <p>This was an assignment using CSS and HTML to create an interior decorating page and adding columns.</p>

    <div class="column">
    <p>I have recently launched a business with a couple of friends for a <span class="highlight">chic-active</span> legging line that donates a portion of the profits to orphans in Botswana. This recent business project spiked my interet to learn some coding in case I ever want to make modifications to our site or create other websites. I also one day want to work remotely (did I mention I'm addicted to travel?)</p>
